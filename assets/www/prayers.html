<h2>3 O'Clock Prayer to the Divine Mercy</h2>

<p>
You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed <br>
forth for souls<br>
and the ocean of mercy opened up for the<br>
whole world.<br>
O Fountain of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy,<br>
envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out<br>
upon us.<br>
O Blood and Water,<br>
which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus<br>
as a fountain of mercy for us,<br>
I trust in You.<br>
Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One,<br>
Have mercy on us and on the whole world. (3
times)<br>
JESUS, King of mercy, I trust in You!<br>
Amen<br>
*Note: In the official R. Catholic version, the last<br>
stanza should read as follows:<br>
"O Blood and Water which flowed out from the
heart of Jesus<br>
as a Fountain of Mercy for us, I trust in You!.
(3x)<br>
Jesus, I Trust in You."<br>
Amen.

The Divine Mercy novena prayers were given to<br>
St. Faustina through an apparition of our Lord<br>
Jesus. Each day has a new petition that seeks<br>
God’s mercy for different purposes.<br>
The message of Divine Mercy is a powerful and<br>
moving way to come closer to Christ.<br>
His Mercy is central to our lives and we must<br>
continually depend on it and ask for it daily.<br>
In addition, this year’s novena leads up to the<br>
day on which Pope John Paul II and Pope John<br>
XXIII will be canonized saints! What a great time<br>
to pray with the Church for Divine Mercy!<br>
Join us in praying the Divine Mercy Novena<br>
beginning this Good Friday!<br>

<h2>Divine Mercy Novena Prayers</h2>
<strong>First Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>

<p>
Intention: Today bring to Me ALL MANKIND,<br>
ESPECIALLY ALL SINNERS, and immerse them in<br>
the ocean of My mercy. In this way you will<br>
console Me in the bitter grief into which the loss<br>
of souls plunges Me.<br>
</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most Merciful Jesus, whose
very nature it is to have compassion on us and
to forgive us, do not look upon our sins but
upon our trust which we place in Your infinite
goodness. Receive us all into the abode of Your
Most Compassionate Heart, and never let us
escape from It. We beg this of You by Your love
which unites You to the Father and the Holy
Spirit.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon all
mankind and especially upon poor sinners, all
enfolded in the Most Compassionate Heart of
Jesus. For the sake of His sorrowful Passion
show us Your mercy, that we may praise the
omnipotence of Your mercy for ever and ever.
Amen.
</p>

<strong>Second Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>
<p>
Intention: Today bring to Me THE SOULS OF
PRIESTS AND RELIGIOUS, and immerse them in
My unfathomable mercy. It was they who gave
Me strength to endure My bitter Passion.
Through them as through channels My mercy
flows out upon mankind.
</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most Merciful Jesus, from
whom comes all that is good, increase Your
grace in men and women consecrated to Your
service,*Â that they may perform worthy works
of mercy; and that all who see them may glorify
the Father of Mercy who is in heaven.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the
company of chosen ones in Your vineyard upon the souls of priests and religious; and
endow them with the strength of Your blessing.
For the love of the Heart of Your Son in which
they are enfolded, impart to them Your power
and light, that they may be able to guide others
in the way of salvation and with one voice sing
praise to Your boundless mercy for ages without
end.
Amen.
</p>

<p>
Third Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:
Intention: Today bring to Me ALL DEVOUT AND
FAITHFUL SOULS, and immerse them in the
ocean of My mercy. The souls brought Me
consolation on the Way of the Cross. They were
that drop of consolation in the midst of an
ocean of bitterness.
</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most Merciful Jesus, from the
treasury of Your mercy, You impart Your graces
in great abundance to each and all. Receive us
into the abode of Your Most Compassionate
Heart and never let us escape from It. We beg
this grace of You by that most wonderous love
for the heavenly Father with which Your Heart
burns so fiercely.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon
faithful souls, as upon the inheritance of Your
Son. For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, grant
them Your blessing and surround them with
Your constant protection. Thus may they never
fail in love or lose the treasure of the holy faith,
but rather, with all the hosts of Angels and
Saints, may they glorify Your boundless mercy
for endless ages.
Amen.
</p>

<strong>Fourth Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>

<p>
Intention: Today bring to Me THOSE WHO DO
NOT BELIEVE IN GOD* AND THOSE WHO DO
NOT YET KNOW ME. I was thinking also of them
during My bitter Passion, and their future zeal
comforted My Heart. Immerse them in the
ocean of My mercy.</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most compassionate Jesus, You
are the Light of the whole world. Receive into
the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart
the souls of those who do not believe in God
and of those who as yet do not know You. Let
the rays of Your grace enlighten them that they,
too, together with us, may extol Your wonderful
mercy; and do not let them escape from the
abode which is Your Most Compassionate Heart.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the
souls of those who do not believe in You, and of
those who as yet do not know You, but who are
enclosed in the Most Compassionate Heart of
Jesus. Draw them to the light of the Gospel.
These souls do not know what great happiness it
is to love You. Grant that they, too, may extol
the generosity of Your mercy for endless ages.
Amen.
</p>

<strong>Fifth Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>

<p>
Intention: Today bring to Me THE SOULS OF
THOSE WHO HAVE SEPARATED THEMSELVES
FROM MY CHURCH, and immerse them in the
ocean of My mercy. During My bitter Passion
they tore at My Body and Heart, that is, My
Church. As they return to unity with the Church,
My wounds heal and in this way they alleviate
My Passion.
</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most Merciful Jesus, Goodness
Itself, You do not refuse light to those who seek
it of You. Receive into the abode of Your Most
Compassionate Heart the souls of those who
have separated themselves from Your Church.
Draw them by Your light into the unity of the
Church, and do not let them escape from the
abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart; but
bring it about that they, too, come to glorify the
generosity of Your mercy.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the
souls of those who have separated themselves
from Your Son’s Church, who have squandered
Your blessings and misused Your graces by
obstinately persisting in their errors. Do not look
upon their errors, but upon the love of Your
own Son and upon His bitter Passion, which He
underwent for their sake, since they, too, are
enclosed in His Most Compassionate Heart. Bring
it about that they also may glorify Your great
mercy for endless ages.
Amen.
</p>

<strong>Sixth Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>

<p>
Intention: Today bring to Me THE MEEK AND
HUMBLE SOULS AND THE SOULS OF LITTLE
CHILDREN, and immerse them in My mercy.
These souls most closely resemble My Heart.
They strengthened Me during My bitter agony. I
saw them as earthly Angels, who will keep vigil
at My altars. I pour out upon them whole
torrents of grace. Only the humble soul is
capable of receiving My grace. I favor humble
souls with My confidence.
</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most Merciful Jesus, You
yourself have said, “Learn from Me for I am
meek and humble of heart.” Receive into the
abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart all
meek and humble souls and the souls of little
children. These souls send all heaven into
ecstasy and they are the heavenly Father’s
favorites. They are a sweet-smelling bouquet
before the throne of God; God Himself takes
delight in their fragrance. These souls have a
permanent abode in Your Most Compassionate
Heart, O Jesus, and they unceasingly sing out a
hymn of love and mercy.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon
meek souls, upon humble souls, and upon little
children who are enfolded in the abode which is
the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. These
souls bear the closest resemblance to Your Son.
Their fragrance rises from the earth and reaches
Your very throne. Father of mercy and of all
goodness, I beg You by the love You bear these
souls and by the delight You take in them: Bless
the whole world, that all souls together may sing
out the praises of Your mercy for endless ages.
Amen.
</p>

<strong>Seventh Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>

<p>
Intention: Today bring to Me THE SOULS WHO
ESPECIALLY VENERATE AND GLORIFY MY MERCY,
and immerse them in My mercy. These souls
sorrowed most over my Passion and entered
most deeply into My spirit. They are living
images of My Compassionate Heart. These souls
will shine with a special brightness in the next
life. Not one of them will go into the fire of hell.
I shall particularly defend each one of them at
the hour of death.
</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most Merciful Jesus, whose
Heart is Love Itself, receive into the abode of
Your Most Compassionate Heart the souls of
those who particularly extol and venerate the
greatness of Your mercy. These souls are mighty
with the very power of God Himself. In the
midst of all afflictions and adversities they go
forward, confident of Your mercy; and united to
You, O Jesus, they carry all mankind on their
shoulders. These souls will not be judged
severely, but Your mercy will embrace them as
they depart from this life.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the
souls who glorify and venerate Your greatest
attribute, that of Your fathomless mercy, and
who are enclosed in the Most Compassionate
Heart of Jesus. These souls are a living Gospel;
their hands are full of deeds of mercy, and their
hearts, overflowing with joy, sing a canticle of
mercy to You, O Most High! I beg You O God:
Show them Your mercy according to the hope
and trust they have placed in You. Let there be
accomplished in them the promise of Jesus, who
said to them that during their life, but especially
at the hour of death, the souls who will
venerate this fathomless mercy of His, He,
Himself, will defend as His glory.
Amen.
</p>

<strong>Eighth Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>

<p>
Intention: Today bring to Me THE SOULS WHO
ARE DETAINED IN PURGATORY, and immerse
them in the abyss of My mercy. Let the torrents
of My Blood cool down their scorching flames.
All these souls are greatly loved by Me. They are
making retribution to My justice. It is in your
power to bring them relief. Draw all the
indulgences from the treasury of My Church and
offer them on their behalf. Oh, if you only knew
the torments they suffer, you would continually
offer for them the alms of the spirit and pay off
their debt to My justice.
</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most Merciful Jesus, You
Yourself have said that You desire mercy; so I
bring into the abode of Your Most
Compassionate Heart the souls in Purgatory,
souls who are very dear to You, and yet, who
must make retribution to Your justice. May the
streams of Blood and Water which gushed forth
from Your Heart put out the flames of
Purgatory, that there, too, the power of Your
mercy may be celebrated.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the
souls suffering in Purgatory, who are enfolded in
the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. I beg
You, by the sorrowful Passion of Jesus Your Son,
and by all the bitterness with which His most
sacred Soul was flooded: Manifest Your mercy to
the souls who are under Your just scrutiny. Look
upon them in no other way but only through the
Wounds of Jesus, Your dearly beloved Son; for
we firmly believe that there is no limit to Your
goodness and compassion.
Amen.
</p>


<strong>Ninth Day of the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>

<p>
Intention: Today bring to Me SOULS WHO HAVE
BECOME LUKEWARM, and immerse them in the
abyss of My mercy. These souls wound My Heart
most painfully. My soul suffered the most
dreadful loathing in the Garden of Olives
because of lukewarm souls. They were the
reason I cried out: ‘Father, take this cup away
from Me, if it be Your will.’ For them, the last
hope of salvation is to run to My mercy.
</p>

<p>
Novena Prayers: Most compassionate Jesus, You
are Compassion Itself. I bring lukewarm souls
into the abode of Your Most Compassionate
Heart. In this fire of Your pure love, let these
tepid souls, who, like corpses, filled You with
such deep loathing, be once again set aflame. O
Most Compassionate Jesus, exercise the
omnipotence of Your mercy and draw them into
the very ardor of Your love, and bestow upon
them the gift of holy love, for nothing is beyond
Your power.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon
lukewarm souls who are nonetheless enfolded in
the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. Father
of Mercy, I beg You by the bitter Passion of
Your Son and by His three-hour agony on the
Cross: Let them, too, glorify the abyss of Your
mercy.
Amen.
</p>


<h2>Divine Mercy Chaplet</h2>
<strong>About the Divine Mercy Novena:</strong>
<p>
The message of Divine Mercy was given to a
Polish nun named Sister Faustina. It was
revealed to her by Jesus in a private revelation
that is fully approved by the Church. The
message of Divine Mercy is not something that is
new or additional to the Gospel message. In
fact, it is the same core message presented in a
particular way with a few new devotions. This
novena is one of those devotions.
St. Faustina reports in her diary that she
transcribed the words of the novena as Jesus
dictated them to her day-by-day beginning on
Good Friday.
While this novena can be prayed any time, it is
fitting that this novena begins on the day that
Jesus gave us His Life. Good Friday is the perfect
time to begin meditating on the Mercy of God
towards us who need His mercy so much.
We end the novena on the eve of the Feast of
Mercy, a feast day established by Pope John
Paul II in response to St. Faustina’s revelation.
This is a very important feast and the novena is
an important part of our preparation for the
Feast of Mercy, Divine Mercy Sunday.
“The Lord told me to say this chaplet for nine
days before the Feast of Mercy. It is to begin on
Good Friday. ‘By this novena, I will grant every
possible grace to souls.’”  (Diary 796)
On April 30th, 2000 Pope John Paul II instituted
Divine Mercy Sunday as an official feast of the
Church. In doing this he said, “by this act today,
I pass on the message of Divine Mercy to the
new millennium. I pass it on because I want
people to know the better face of God, and that
of his Divine Mercy, and through it, the better
face of their brethren. The light of the message
of Divine Mercy which the Lord wished to renew
in the world, will be as much a beacon of hope
for the third millennium, as the apostles were in
the first.”
This is clearly a very important and powerful
devotion.
Purpose of the Devotion
You can pray the Divine Mercy Novena for any
reason you want. God’s Mercy is relevant and
effective in all parts of our lives. However, there
are some specific reasons you may want to call
on the Divine Mercy in your prayer life.
For the dying
For Poland
For forgiveness and mercy
For conversion
For healing
In preparation for Divine Mercy Sunday
So, let us join together and beg for God’s Divine
Mercy together through this Divine Mercy
Novena!
